**Design Patterns in JAVA** 

This project demonstrates the application of various design patterns in Java language. The patterns are divided into groups and can be found in three files corresponding to the categories of Creational Patterns, Structural Patterns and Behavourial Patterns.

**Implemented Patterns:**

Singleton and Factory Patterns (Main.java) Singleton Pattern: Ensures that under any given circumstance only one instance of a particular Schedule Manager is created for the purpose of carrying out task management. Factory Pattern: The TaskFactory creates new tasks depending on the priority status (High, Low) of the tasks.

Observer and Command Patterns (MainCommandObserver.java) Observer Pattern: Notifies users (observers) on addition or removal of any tasks in the system. Command Pattern: Assumption of operation about task actions of adding or removing them inside an object where the action is held until requested for along with other actions.

Adapter and Decorator Patterns (MainAdapterDecorator.java) Adapter Pattern: makes it possible for the system to allow importing of task data of other supporting formats like CSV and JSON without affecting the systems core functionality. Decorator Pattern: allows for the augmentation of the task by features (for instance dead lines) without changing the structure of the task.

**How to Execute the Project:**

Compile the Code: Now, go to the root directory of the project, find the command acceptor and issue it the command: “javac *.java”. 
It will compile all the .java files present in the directory.
